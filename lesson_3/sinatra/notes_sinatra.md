# Sinatra and Web Frameworks 

Sinatra is a Rack-based web development framework.
  - Rack-based means uses Rack to connect to a web server like WEBrick
  - provides conventions for placing application code
  - built-in capabilities for routing, view templates, etc. 

**At its core, Sinatra is nothing more than some Ruby code connecting to a TCP server, handling requests and sending back responses in a HTTP-compliant string format**
