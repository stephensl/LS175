# Rack 

Rack is a generic interface to help application developers connect to web servers. 

We are essentially replacing our TCP server with WEBrick and RUby code with a Rack application.

When working with Rack applications, entire server is comprised of the Rack application adn a web server (WEBrick in this case). 

*Most developers wouldn't write Rack applications except for the simplest of situations*
