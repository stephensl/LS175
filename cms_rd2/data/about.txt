“In the free element beneath me swam, Floundered and dived, in play,
in chace, in battle, Fishes of every colour, form, and kind; Which
language cannot paint, and mariner Had never seen; from dread
Leviathan To insect millions peopling every wave: Gather’d in shoals
immense, like floating islands, Led by mysterious instincts through
that waste And trackless region, though on every side Assaulted by
voracious enemies, Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or
jaw, With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.”
—_Montgomery’s World before the Flood_.
